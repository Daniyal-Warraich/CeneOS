A bunch of ways to hang my OS as an application

### Call an interrupt 1 - 31

In 'normal' operating systems, the offending process (the app) will get cut. In mine, the system hangs (yay).

```
int main()
{
    asm("int $30");
    return 1;
}
```

### A simple while (true)

You know how you can make your app 'hang' by doing: `while (true) {}`? Well, if you do that in an app for this OS, you hang the OS. And there's nothing the user can do. No key binds, nothing.

```
int main()
{
    while (true) {}
    return 1;
}
```
