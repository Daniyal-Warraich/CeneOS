# ReallyBadOS
An operating system.

## Running
Run this in QEMU (which is tested): `make run`

## Building
See building on the [main page](https://daniyalw.github.io/ReallyBadOS/).

## Disclaimer
Bad code can be found everywhere. Take a look for yourself if you don't believe me.

This project has shown that I suck at C++. I could probably compile it as C with a few modifications.
