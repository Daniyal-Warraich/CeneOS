# ReallyBadOS
An operating system.

## Running
Run this in QEMU (which is tested): `make run`

## Building
See building on the [main page](https://daniyal-warraich.github.io/ReallyBadOS/#building).

## Website
I know GitHub shows the site in the repository details, but it is all lowercased for some odd reason, and leads to an error. [Use this link](https://daniyal-warraich.github.io/ReallyBadOS/).
