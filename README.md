# CeneOS
An operating system. Built by me, for no reason at all (maybe learning?).

Do not expect the code to be good. It's probably not.

It's in your best interests if you don't copy code for work or school; you'll get a bad mark on your assignment, or you'll get fired.


## Run
You should run it in QEMU: `qemu run/kernel.bin`
